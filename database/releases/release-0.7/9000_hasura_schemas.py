# This file prepares the database for the Hasura GraphQL engine.
#
# Hasura needs two schemas that will hold tables with operational data.
# These tables need to be readable and writeable by the user who accesses
# the data from Hasura (the <username> in the DATABASE_URI). However, the
# user creating these schemas must be superuser.
#
# In other words: the user running sql_scriptrunner.py must be superuser,
# while the user mentioned in this script must be an ordinary user. The
# latter user is not know at development time, and will be replaced upon
# execution by sql_scriptrunner.py. For this reason, this file is a python
# file and not a pure SQL file.
#
# For more info, see:
# https://hasura.io/docs/1.0/graphql/core/deployment/postgres-requirements.html
