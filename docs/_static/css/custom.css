/*
This custom CSS disables the dispay of values in the definition of constants.
It is only used in the constants module.

Module variable are autodetected by the ::autodata directive  sphinx-autodoc.
This is what we want. They are displayed like this:

odyssey.constants.COUNTRIES = (('AF', 'Afghanistan'), ('AX', ...))

except that the full definition list is shown in the documentation. This is
not what we want, lengthy lists are distracting in the documentation. It can
be turned off by setting:

.. autodata:: odyssey.constants.COUNTRIES
   :annotation:

in docs/odyssey/odyssey.constants.rst, but then autodetection is disabled and
every new constant has to be added to the documentation manually. That is also
not what we want.

As a compromise, we keep using the autodata function of autodoc, but hide the
values with this custom css.
