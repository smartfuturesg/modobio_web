<p> </p>
<p>These terms
and conditions of use (&ldquo;Terms of Use&rdquo;) cover your use of and access to the
website located at www.modobio.com
(&ldquo;Site&rdquo;), which is owned
and operated by Modo Bio LLC and its affiliates (collectively, &ldquo;Company&rdquo;, &ldquo;we&rdquo;,
&ldquo;us&rdquo;, or &ldquo;our&rdquo;), our applications (including mobile applications), software,
APIs, and any other product or service provided by Company in connection with
wearable device technology (together, the &ldquo;Services&rdquo;). The Services include access
to a telehealth
platform (&ldquo;Platform&rdquo;) that analyzes
clients&rsquo; wearable device technology metrics, and connects such clients to a
network of independent physicians and other health care and wellness professionals,
who offer medical evaluations by using telephonic and
telecommunications-enabled care (the &ldquo;Clinical and Wellness Services&rdquo;).  </p>
<p>Modo
Bio does not take responsibility for the accuracy, reliability, availability,
effectiveness, or correct use of information received through the client&rsquo;s
wearable device.</p>
<p>Modo Bio
does not provide the Clinical and Wellness Services.  Clinical and Wellness
Services are provided by independent, third-party providers (&ldquo;Clinical and

non-medical services to the Clinical and Wellness Providers in order for the
Clinical and Wellness Providers to use our Platform to provide you with
telehealth consultations.  </p>

Clinical and Wellness Providers is independent of Modo Bio</p>

<p><b>Medical
Information</b></p>
<p>The Services may
contain general information related to medical conditions, research, testing,
and treatment, and other health care topics. Any such information is provided
for informational purposes only. The receipt of any such information does not
create a professional relationship between you and Company. THE SERVICES SHOULD
NOT BE RELIED UPON AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR QUALIFIED MEDICAL ADVICE OR CONSULTATION
WITH A PHYSICIAN OR OTHER QUALIFIED HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL. You should always
consult with a doctor or other health care professional for medical advice or
information about diagnosis and treatment.</p>
<p><b>Telehealth
Consultations and Consent to Treatment</b></p>
<p>Through your use
of the Services, you may have the opportunity to consult with Clinical and
Wellness Providers via telephonic or other electronic media (&ldquo;Telehealth
Consultations&rdquo;). Telehealth Consultations are limited to non-emergency family
medicine and wellness information and appointments and shall not include emergency
services or specific medical specialties, including without limitation, prescribing
any controlled substances. You understand that there are inherent risks and
limitations associated with a Telehealth Consultation (i.e., not an in-person
visit) with a Clinical and Wellness Provider, including, but not limited to,
risks and limitations arising from such Clinical and Wellness Provider&rsquo;s
ability, or inability, to comprehensively assess and accurately diagnose
illness, injury, or disease using remote, electronic communications. By creating
an Account, or otherwise using the Clinical and Wellness Services, you give
permission to the Clinical and Wellness Providers to provide you with medical and
wellness care. You may withdraw this consent at any time by no longer seeking
care from the Clinical and Wellness Providers or by providing notice to Company
of such withdrawal. The Clinical and Wellness Providers have the right to
refuse access to the Clinical and Wellness Services to any person at any time,
for any reason, or for no reason at all.</p>
<p>Company is not
responsible for the quality and appropriateness of the Clinical and Wellness
Services or the care the Clinical and Wellness Providers render to you. The
doctor-patient relationship (or other similar relationship between you and a
medical or wellness professional) is between you and the Clinical and Wellness Provider.
Your interactions with the Clinical and Wellness Providers via Telehealth
Consultations are not intended to replace your relationship of your other
health care practitioners or primary care physician. Neither Company, nor any
of its subsidiaries or affiliates or any third party who may promote the Clinical
and Wellness Services, shall be liable for any professional advice obtained
from a Clinical and Wellness Provider via Telehealth Consultation, or any
information obtained on the Clinical and Wellness Services.</p>
<p>By creating an Account
and accessing the Clinical and Wellness Services, you acknowledge that you
understand the risks and benefits of telehealth, you have received adequate
answers to any questions you have about the use of telehealth, and you consent
to the use of telehealth in the delivery of health care services to you.</p>
<p>The Clinical and
Wellness Providers operate subject to state and federal regulations related to
Telehealth Consultations, and thus, Telehealth Consultations may not be
available in your state or limited in scope. You represent that you are not a
person barred from enrolling for and/or receiving Telehealth Consultations
under the laws of the United States or other applicable jurisdictions in which
you may be located. Access to and use of the Telehealth Consultations is
limited exclusively to users located in states within the United States where
the Clinical and Wellness Services are available.</p>
<p>Neither Company, nor
any Clinical and Wellness Provider shall bill any health plan, health
insurance, or third party payor for Telehealth Consultations provided as part
of the Clinical and Wellness Services. By agreeing to use the Clinical and
Wellness Services, you acknowledge and agree that you will pay directly for any
Clinical and Wellness Services, including Telehealth Consultations provided to
you, and neither Company nor any Clinical and Wellness Provider will bill any
insurance, including federal or state health care programs, for such Clinical
and Wellness Services.</p>
<p><b>Eligibility</b></p>
<p>By using the Services,
including accessing the Clinical and Wellness Services, you acknowledge and
agree that (a) the Telehealth Consultations are provided at the sole discretion
of the Clinical and Wellness Providers; (b) the Telehealth Consultations are
limited to diagnosis and treatment of those non-emergent medical condition appropriate

reimbursable by Medicare, Medicaid or any other government health care program,
and you agree not to seek coverage for any Services that are not reimbursable
by such programs; (e) the Services may not be reimbursable by commercial
insurers, managed care organizations, preferred provider organizations or other
payors, but you may separately from Company seek reimbursement from any such
payor for the cost of use of the Services (f) you are at least 18 years of age,
or accompanied by a parent or guardian who can give informed consent on your
behalf if you are under the age of 18 at the time of the consultation; and (g)
if you are seeking services on behalf of a child, dependent or other person for
whose medical care you are responsible, your approval of these Terms of Use
will bind such other person to these terms.</p>
<p><b>Billing </b></p>
<p>Company may
charge a fee for any appointment that you book via the Services.  Upon creating
an Account, the App Store will charge a monthly subscription fee (the &ldquo;Subscription
Fee&rdquo;) for access and use of the Platform and other Services pursuant to such
App Store&rsquo;s online terms of service, which can be found at https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/us/terms.html and https://play.google.com/intl/en-US_us/about/play-terms/index.html. Any telehealth payments will be processed via an online portal
through the Platform. In connection with the processing of such telehealth payments,
we do not maintain financial information such as credit card numbers on our
internal databases. Rather, all such information is provided to our third party
processor, currently InstaMed Communications, LLC (&ldquo;Payment Provider&rdquo;), whose
use of your personal information is governed by their own privacy policy, which
may be viewed at https://www.instamed.com/privacy-statement/. If Company does
not receive payment from your Payment Provider, you agree to pay all amounts
due upon demand. You agree to pay all charges at the prices then in effect for
any use of the Services by you or other persons (including your agents). Company
reserves the right to correct any errors or mistakes that it makes even if it
has already requested or received payment.</p>
<p>YOU MUST CANCEL
YOUR SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE IT RENEWS TO AVOID BEING CHARGED THE SUBSCRIPTION FEE
FOR THE NEXT RENEWAL TERM. ANY AND ALL REQUESTS FOR SUBSCRIPTION CANCELLATION
SHALL BE SUBMITTED TO THE APP STORE PURSUANT TO ITS TERMS OF USE. </p>
<p><b>Prescriptions</b></p>
<p>Clinical and
Wellness Providers write prescriptions in accordance with their license, independent
professional judgment, and federal and state law. Prescriptions may be written
only for the limited medical conditions. You will not be able to obtain a
prescription product unless you have completed a consultation with a Clinical
and Wellness Provider. There is no guarantee that a Clinical and Wellness Provider
will write you a prescription. The Clinical and Wellness Providers do not write
prescriptions for DEA controlled substances. </p>
<p>If a Clinical and
Wellness Provider determines a prescription is appropriate for you and writes a
prescription, you may fill the prescription at any pharmacy of your choice.
Certain prescriptions can be filled through a mail-order pharmacy. Other
prescriptions are not available through a mail-order pharmacy and must be
filled by a local pharmacy of your choice. You will be prompted to state your
choice of pharmacy during your use of the Services.</p>
<p>If you complete a
consultation with a Clinical and Wellness Provider and fill a prescription
through a mail-order pharmacy, the prescription product will be shipped to you
by the applicable pharmacy. Mail-order pharmacies are third-parties,
independent of Company. </p>
<p>For all
prescriptions, you or your health insurance are responsible for the cost of the
prescription product. If you fill a prescription with a pharmacy other than a
mail-order pharmacy, Company will send the prescription to your selected
pharmacy, but you will be responsible for picking up or otherwise obtaining the
prescription product and paying the pharmacy directly for the cost of the
prescription product.</p>

thereof, including all questions of arbitrability, shall be settled by
arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;) in
accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules by a sole arbitrator. The
parties hereto shall endeavor to agree upon the arbitrator, and if they fail to
do so within twenty-one (21) days of the commencement of the Arbitration, the
appointment shall be made by the AAA in accordance with the Commercial
Arbitration Rules. The place, or legal seat of arbitration, shall be Florida,
and the language of the arbitration shall be English.</p>
<p>You may only
bring claims in your individual capacity on your own behalf, and not in any
representative capacity or on behalf of any class or purported class, and no
arbitration you commence hereunder may be joined with or include any claims by
any other persons. Each party shall be exclusively responsible for paying its
own arbitration filing fees, which may later be allocated by the arbitrator as
set forth below.</p>
<p>The arbitrator
shall issue a reasoned award and, subject to the limitation of liability set
forth above, shall have the power to grant any interim or provisional measures
that the arbitrator deems appropriate, including, but not limited to,
injunctive relief and specific performance, and any interim or provisional
measures ordered by the arbitrator may be specifically enforced by any court of
competent jurisdiction as a final award. Nothing herein, however, shall
authorize the arbitrator to act as amiable compositeurs, to proceed ex aequo et
bono, or to exercise rights of jura novit curia. Each party hereto retains the
right to seek interim measures from a judicial authority, and any such request
shall not be deemed incompatible with the agreement to arbitrate or a waiver of
the right to arbitrate. The arbitrator shall award the prevailing party, if any
as determined by the arbitrator, its reasonable costs, including reasonable
attorney&rsquo;s fees. Judgment on any award rendered by the arbitrator may be
entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. No information concerning an
arbitration, beyond the names of the parties, their counsel or the relief
requested, may be unilaterally disclosed to a third party by any party unless
required by law. Any documentary or other evidence given by any party or
witness in any arbitration shall be treated as confidential by any party whose
access to such evidence arises exclusively because of its participation in the
arbitration and shall not be disclosed to any third party (other than a witness
or expert), except as may be required by law. Any party who commences any
judicial proceeding in connection with an arbitration initiated hereunder shall
endeavor to have the judicial record of any such proceeding sealed to the
extent permitted by law.</p>
