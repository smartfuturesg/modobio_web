<p>Congratulations! You are ready to take your next steps in developing and following a customized, proactive, and natural response to your personal health issues and goals. Modo Bio works with you, to create a highly personal, continuously assessed health solution, supported by data analysis.</p>

<p>You have already completed your initial consultation. Now, together with your Modo Bio Team Members, you have a highly personalized and sustainable plan for optimization of your well-being, performance, and healthcare. This Subscription Agreement puts the plan into action. Together, you and Modo Bio will help you maximize your health and wellness.</p>

<p>The Modo Bio Subscription plan provides the following each month:
<ul>
    <li>Eight 60-minute training sessions (twice a week) with Parker Condit. The training sessions are valued $120 each, for a total value of $960 per month.</li>
    <li>One 30-minute consultation with Dr. Michael Kay on your physical movement and activity. The consults are valued $200 each, for a total value of $200 per month.</li>
    <li>One 30-minute consultation on your medical and nutritional progress, for which we will refer you to Dr. Adam Douglas, whose practice is conveniently located adjacent to our offices. The consults are valued $200 each, for a total value of $200 per month.</li>
    <li>Wearable device bio-data monitoring and analysis. Digital monitoring is valued at $50 per month.</li>
    <li>Total value of the provided services is $1,410.</li>
</ul>

<p>A Modo Bio subscription costs $1,000 per month, for a 3-month commitment. After 3 months, the subscription will automatically renew for another 3-month period. Payment is required in advance.</p>

<p><strong>Please note the following stipulations</strong>:
<ul>
    <li>Consultations may take place in person or by video, depending on scheduling.</li>
    <li>The Modo Bio program requires you to obtain an Oura Ring device to track bio-data. We have found the Oura Ring superior for tracking relevant information, although we may add other wearables to the program in the future.</li>
    <li>You may purchase an Oura Ring directly from Oura, or from Modo Bio.</li>
    <li>You must give Modo Bio access to your wearable device data, which may require you to execute a consent or enter a consent on a website to release your biodata to us.</li>
    <li>Bio-data analysis may require up to 9 months or more of data to provide useful information.</li>
    <li>Regular participation in all sessions and consultations is required for best results with the Modo Bio program. Sessions and consultations are scheduled on a monthly basis, and unused sessions and consultations do not roll over or carry forward.</li>
    <li>Bio-data analysis may be performed by a Modo Bio Team Member, or by third-party contractors.</li>
    <li>When available, Modo Bio plans to offer customized nutritional supplements for clients, which are not included in the subscription fee but which instead are available for purchase. The anticipated price for the customized nutritional supplement is $10 per bottle.</li>
    <li>When available, Modo Bio plans to offer customized hormonal supplements and gene injections for clients, which are not included in the subscription fee but which instead are available for purchase.</li>
</ul></p>

<h1>FAQ</h1>

<p><i>Can I just come and use the gym with Parker without buying the subscription?</i></br>
No, as we can't stand over the results and we donâ€™t want clients failing on their objectives as it reflects badly on us.</p>

<p><i>Can I just come back and pay $350 for another assessment with Dr. Kay and Dr. Douglas?</i><br>
Yes, you can have as many assessments as you want but it will cost you $400 for 60 minutes as their time sells at $200 for 30 minutes (we discount it to $350 for the initial introduction). You can't just see Dr. Michael Kay without seeing Dr. Adam Douglas or vice versa as our insurance requires that it is structured as two doctors looking at you together.</p>

<p><i>Can I just sign up for the Oura ring monitoring?</i><br>
Yes, that is $50 per month and it will probably take around 9 months to collect any meaningful data to analyse.</p>
