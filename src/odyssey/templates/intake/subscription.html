<p>Congratulations! You are ready to take your next steps in developing and following a customized, proactive, and natural response to your personal health issues and goals. Modo Bio works with you, to create a highly personal, continuously assessed health solution, supported by data analysis.</p>

<p>You have already completed your initial consultation. Now, together with your Modo Bio Team Members, you have a highly personalized and sustainable plan for optimization of your well-being, performance, and healthcare. This Subscription Agreement puts the plan into action. Together, you and Modo Bio will help you maximize your health and wellness.</p>

<p>The Modo Bio Subscription plan provides the following each month:
<ul>
    <li>Twelve one-hour in-person training sessions (three per week).</li>
    <li>Two 30-minute consultations with Dr. Adam Douglas on your medical and nutritional progress.</li>
    <li>Wearable device bio-data monitoring and analysis.</li>
    <li>Two 30-minute consultations on your medical and nutritional progress, for which we will refer you to Dr. Adam Douglas, whose practice is conveniently located adjacent to our offices.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note:
<ul>
    <li>Consultations may take place in person or by video, depending on scheduling.</li>
    <li>The Modo Bio program requires you to obtain an Oura Ring device to track bio-data. We have found the Oura Ring superior for tracking relevant information, although we may add other wearables to the program in the future.</li>
    <li>You may purchase an Oura Ring directly from Oura, or from Modo Bio. We will provide an Oura Ring for clients who sign up for a minimum 6-month program at no charge.</li>
    <li>You must give Modo Bio access to your wearable device data, which may require you to execute a consent or enter a consent of a website to release your biodata to us.</li>
    <li>Bio-data analysis may require up to 9 months or more of data to provide useful information.</li>
    <li>Regular participation in all sessions and consultations is required for best results with the Modo Bio program. Sessions and consultations are scheduled on a monthly basis, and unused sessions and consultations do not roll over or carry forward.</li>
    <li>Bio-data analysis may be performed by a Modo Bio Team Member, or by third-party contractors.</li>
    <li>When available, Modo Bio plans to offer customized nutritional supplements for clients, which are not included in the subscription fee but which instead are available for purchase. The anticipated price for the customized nutritional supplement is $10 per bottle.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>A Modo Bio subscription costs $1,000 per month, for a 3-month commitment. Payment is required in advance.</p>
