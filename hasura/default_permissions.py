"""
Hasura gives us flexibility to authorize user access through special claims embedded in our JWTs. 
These claims should summarize a userâ€™s level of access when requesting a resource from our database. 
Currently we use a combination of a 4 interworking resource access systems:

1. Context-based access: 
    We have client and staff users who will access both their own resources and those of other users.
2. Role-based access (staff): 
    Staff members may only view and manipulate data which falls under their purview. 
    Ex. doctors may only access medical-specific resources while physical trainers may have no access 
    or restricted access to client medical data. 
3. User-specific access:
    Clients must specify whether another user should be able to see their data. 
    Currently this is implemented through the clinical care team system, but we expect to build 
    a similar system in the future where clients must explicitly give access of their resources to 
    specific staff members.
4. Table-level access (clinical care team): 
    Clients are given the option to specify which data they will grant a member of their care team access to. 
    Care team members may be other users. 

Permissions can be applied to a table in hasura by editing the `permissions` area of a table's metadata.
In yaml format, these permissions look like:
"select_permissions": [
        {
          "role": "client",
          "permission": {
            "columns": [
              "created_at",
              "updated_at",
              "user_id",
              "modobio_id"
            ],
            "filter": {
              "user_id": {
                "_eq": "X-Hasura-User-Id"
              }
            }
          }

Broken down here

    - the type of request. Must be one of:
        - select_permissions
        - insert_permissions
        - update_permissions

    - role: the user type the user is making the request from. In our cases, this is ('staff', or 'client')
    - permission: consists of two fields which control which columns and rows are accessible
        - columns: which columns are accessible
        - filter: controls the rows that are returned. If none of the filter requirements are met, no data is returned.
