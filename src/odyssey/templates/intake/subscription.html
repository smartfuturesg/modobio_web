<p>Congratulations! You are ready to take your next steps in developing and following a customized, proactive, and natural response to your personal health issues and goals. Modo Bio works with you, to create a highly personal, continuously assessed health solution, supported by data analysis.</p>

<p>You have already completed your initial consultation. Now, together with your Modo Bio Team Members, you have a highly personalized and sustainable plan for optimization of your well-being, performance, and healthcare. This Subscription Agreement puts the plan into action. Together, you and Modo Bio will help you maximize your health and wellness.</p>

<p>The Modo Bio Subscription plan provides the following each month:
<ul>
    <li>Twelve one-hour in-person training sessions (three per week).</li>
    <li>Two 30-minute consultations with Dr. Adam Douglas on your medical and nutritional progress.</li>
    <li>Two 30-minute consultations with Dr. Michael Kay on your physical movement and activity
    wearable device bio-data monitoring and analysis.</li>
</ul>


<p>Please note:
<ul>
    <li>Consultations may take place in person or by video, depending on scheduling.</li>
    <li>The Modo Bio program requires you to obtain an Oura Ring device to track bio-data. We have found the Oura Ring superior for tracking relevant information, although we may add other wearables to the program in the future.</li>
    <li>You may purchase an Oura Ring directly from Oura, or from Modo Bio. We will provide an Oura Ring for clients who sign up for a minimum 6-month program at no charge.</li>
    <li>You must give Modo Bio access to your wearable device data, which may require you to execute a consent or enter a consent of a website to release your biodata to us.</li>
    <li>Bio-data analysis may require up to 9 months or more of data to provide useful information.</li>
    <li>Regular participation in all sessions and consultations is required for best results with the Modo Bio program. Sessions and consultations are scheduled on a monthly basis, and unused sessions and consultations do not roll over or carry forward.</li>
    <li>Bio-data analysis may be performed by a Modo Bio Team Member, or by third-party contractors.</li>
    <li>When available, Modo Bio plans to offer customized nutritional supplements for clients, which are not included in the subscription fee but which instead are available for purchase. The anticipated price for the customized nutritional supplement is $<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">XXX</span> per bottle.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>A Modo Bio subscription costs $2,000 per month, or $20,000 with 12-month commitment. Payment is required in advance.</p>

<h1>Modo Bio Policies</h1>

<p><strong>Payment</strong>: Modo Bio requires payment in advance. Modo Bio will not bill insurance, and you agree to be a cash-pay client, at rates set by Modo Bio. If you choose to submit any insurance claims yourself, you understand that Modo Bio services are out-of-network, and Modo Bio does not promise reimbursement by any insurance provider. Modo Bio accepts payment by cash, electronic transfer, check, or credit card. There is a $25 fee for checks returned for non-sufficient funds.</p>

<p><strong>Cancellation fee</strong>: Modo Bio will charge a cancellation fee of $100 if you cancel an appointment within 48 hours of the scheduled time. If you cancel less than 24 hours before your appointment time, the cancellation fee is the full payment for the Module.</p>

<p><strong>Disputes</strong>: you agree that any disputes arising out of this Agreement shall be arbitrated in Maricopa County, Arizona, under the Arizona Revised Uniform Arbitration Act, A.R.S. &sect;12-3001 et seq., and the then-current American Arbitration Association (AAA) rules. Although the AAA rules shall apply, the arbitration shall not be conducted by or through AAA. Unless we mutually agree on an arbitrator within 30 days of a demand for arbitration, the arbitrator shall be appointed by the Presiding Civil Judge of the Maricopa County Superior Court and shall be an attorney with at least 10 years’ experience in healthcare law. The arbitrator shall issue a written, reasoned opinion within 60 days of conducting an arbitration hearing, which shall be binding and non-appealable.</p>

<p><strong>Disclosure of material health information</strong>: Modo Bio clients are required to disclose relevant medical information that could affect the Modo Bio program, any Modo Bio Team Member, or any other Modo Bio client. Your safety, and ours, depends on you providing accurate and complete information on your Client Information form, including any exposure to HIV/AIDS or COVID-19.</p>

<p><strong>Consent to use health information</strong>: you agree to release health information to Modo Bio as provided on the Modo Bio Release of Information form, which must be signed and returned before your first appointment.</p>

<p><strong>Scope</strong>: Modo Bio is not a substitute for regular checkups and medical care. You should have a primary care physician on your healthcare team, who can refer you to specialists for any healthcare needs (including behavioral health). Modo Bio uses your health-related information for lifestyle management and improvement, but the Modo Bio program does not replace your need for regular checkups and healthcare services.</p>

<p><strong>Language, translation services, and hearing-impaired clients</strong>: Modo Bio personnel are English-speaking only and cannot communicate effectively in any other language. Non-English-speaking clients must bring an adequate translator with them to every appointment, as Modo Bio does NOT offer translation services. If you require a translator but did not bring one with you, your appointment will be cancelled. Deaf or hearing-impaired clients should bring their own sign-language translators (often family members or friends, for example), provided that the translator is skilled enough to communicate detailed healthcare information effectively.</p>

<p><strong>Discharge policy</strong>: Modo Bio may discharge clients for such reasons as non-compliance, outstanding balance or failure to pay on account, being a "no-show" or late arrival, failure to establish an effective relationship, differing healthcare or lifestyle philosophies, disrespecting a Modo Bio Team Member, creating conflict, and so on. Formal discharge from Modo Bio is at our sole discretion.</p>

<p><strong>Alcohol and substance abuse notification</strong>: abuse of alcohol or drugs, whether licit or illicit, can significantly affect a client’s participation in the Modo Bio Program. Clients must understand that their success may be limited significantly if they continue to use illicit drugs and/or alcohol. Because interactions between alcohol or drug use with certain aspects of the Modo Bio program can be catastrophic or potentially fatal, clients must be forthcoming regarding any substance use or abuse issues.</p>

<p><strong>Fragrance-free and quiet environment</strong>: Modo Bio tries to maintain a suitable environment for health optimization, including low-intensity lighting, quiet, and a scent-free environment. Clients must avoid wearing strong odors, whether from perfumes or grooming products. We also ask that clients put their cellphones on vibrate, refrain from talking on your phone while at Modo Bio, and use headphones or earbuds for listening to any electronic device.</p>

<p><strong>Audio and video recording</strong>: clients may not record any part of their sessions at Modo Bio without permission.</p>

<p><strong>Pregnancy and lactation warning</strong>: women clients of childbearing age are responsible to let their Modo Bio Team Member know if they are pregnant, may be pregnant, attempting to become pregnant, not practicing reliable birth control or breastfeeding. Clients at all times should keep their Modo Bio Team Member aware of their pregnancy, pregnancy potential, and breastfeeding status.</p>

<p><strong>After-hours policy</strong>: Modo Bio responds to client questions and concerns during regular business hours, M-F, 9 am to 5 pm. The Client Portal can be used after hours to submit questions; responses to routine questions, however, may take up to 2 business days via the portal. Do not submit emergent or urgent medical issues through the Portal. If you have a significant medical issue, you should directly proceed to the nearest emergency department or dial 911.</p>
